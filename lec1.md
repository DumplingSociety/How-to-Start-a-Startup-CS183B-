## You need a great idea, a great product, a great team, and great execution

- Most greate companies start with a great idea, not a pivot
- someday you need to build a business that is diffcult to replicate
- the idea should come first and the startup should come second
- the best ideas often look terrible at the beginning
- You want to sound crazy, but you want to actually be right. And you want an idea that not many other people are working on. And it's okay if it doesn't sound big at first
- You have to find a small market in which you can get a monopoly and then quickly expand
- You need a market that's going to be big in 10 years
- Another version of this, that gets down to the same idea, is Sequoia's famous question: Why now? Why is this the perfect time for this particular idea, and to start this particular company. Why couldn't it be done two years ago, and why will two years in the future be too late?
- Any company that's a clone of something else, that already exists, with some small or made up differentiator—like X, beautiful design, or Y for people that like red wine instead—that usually fails
- To build a really great company, you first have to turn a great idea into a great produc
- At YC, we tell founders to work on their product, talk to users, exercise, eat and sleep, and very little else
- Build something that a small number of users love
- There's like a limit to the area under the curve, of what you can build. So you can build something that a large number of users like a little bit, or a small number of users love a lot
- One way that you know when this is working, is that you'll get growth by word of mouth. If you get something people love, people will tell their friends about it. This works for consumer product and enterprise products as well. When people really love something, they'll tell their friends about it, and you'll see organic growth
- If you find yourself talking about how it's okay that you're not growing—because there's a big partnership that's going to come save you or something like that—its almost always a sign of real trouble
- Very few startups die from competition. Most die because they themselves fail to make something users love, they spend their time on other things
- Another piece of advice to make something that users love: start with something simple. Its much much easier to make a great product if you have something simple. start with as little surface area as possible.
- Ben Silbermann, when everyone thought Pinterest was a joke, recruited the initial Pinterest users by chatting up strangers in coffee shops. He really did, he just walked around Palo Alto and said "Will you please use my product?" He also used to run around the Apple store in Palo Alto, and he would like set all the browsers to the Pinterest homepage real quick, before they caught him and kicked him out, (laughter) and so that when people walked in they were like "Oh, what's this?". This is an important example of doing things that don't scale.
- You want to build an engine in the company that transforms feedback from users into product decisions
